 and transfer the ability to claim the staked APT. 
This is ideal not only for decentralization of the network, but also also creates a more stable ROI for the 'staker',

 as rewards fluctuate with validator performance and is dependent on its inclusion in the validator set

    1. number of successful votes cast
    2. the remaining lockup period
