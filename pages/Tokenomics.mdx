# SEAM Token Structure

$SEAM is the utility, governance, and staking token which acts as the mechanism for decentralized governance over SeamDAO. The SEAM token adopts the [Coin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move) type developed by Aptos, using Aptos Move code. The SeamDAO will deploy the SEAM coin contract on November 30, 2022 with a max supply of 1,000,000,000 SEAM.

## Protocol Revenue

A 0.3% transaction fee is charged on total deposit amount into a Seam Power Set. This acts as a way for the protocol to load up on coins to pay for gas fees from the strategy's transaction flow. Another 5% is charged on the profit a user earns from their Seam Power Set position.

Of the 5% management fee on each position, 20% gets sent to the SeamDAO treasury and 80% is converted to SEAM/USDC LP and distributed to SEAM stakers.

## Token Utility
