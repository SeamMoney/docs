Seam is building the first structured staking product platform for LPs for institutions and everyday users on aptos.

what we are building
    1. Seam Staking - staked APT as a defi primitive
    2. Seam Yield : multi-protocol composed stratigies
    3. Seam Dao : participant incentivized validator management platform and tooling

Seam aims to add value and composability to the aptos ecosystem
 by:
    1. providing a mechanism for transfering the ability to claim a stake position on a validator(s)
    2. allow the sale of these contracts via (traditional,dutch and fixed auctions)
    3. allow users to manage
