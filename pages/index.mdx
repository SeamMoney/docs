# Seam

Structured staking, Yield composer & multi-purpose Explorer for Aptos

Seam is building the first composable products platform on aptos
 staking + yield platform for LPs for institutions and everyday users on aptos.

**what we are building** 
1. Seam Staking - staked APT as a defi primitive (will explain how this is different from liquid staking)
2. Seam Yield : multi-protocol composed stratigies 
3. Seam Dao : participant incentivized validator management platform and tooling

Seam aims to add value and composability to the aptos ecosystem
by: 
1. providing a mechanism for transfering of the ability to claim a stake position on a validator(s) 
2. allow the sale of these contracts via (traditional,dutch and fixed auctions) 
3. allow users to compose complex positions across Pools, Orderbooks and lending markets
