## AIT3 : current network phase
  - build out staking interface to support multi-validator staking and sale of staked positions

# AIT4 - last phase before launch
for AIT4 our staking UI will be live, allowing validator operators to list their node on our UI
 and for a traditional user to deploy stake to a pool of validator(s). on deposit of stake users get a Token
  will be.

during this phase we will also be indexing validator performance to select validators for our curated multi-validator stake pools

 # Aptos Mainnet Launch
we are aiming to launch the following features
- supporting 3-5 defi protocols on Aptos for swaps, pools etc.
- support 4 wallets 
- protocol managed staking mechanism
- multi-strat/LP pools
- transaction + Dapp module explorer


## After mainnet launch
once core staking and yield mechanisms are built out we are going to shift our focus towards building out our Dao and iterating on our implementation of Composables and 

more info about the Dao can be found here [link]("/dao")

## Our Goals
  - provide users with an in

  - capture at least 8% of the staking marketshare on aptos
  - allow institutions to easy manage stake across multiple validators
