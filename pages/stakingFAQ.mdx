## Why stake with Seam?

Seam allows users to split stake deposits across multiple validators,
 and transfer the ability to claim the staked APT. 
This is ideal not only for decentralization of the network, but also also creates a more stable ROI for the 'staker',
and allows the user to stake any amount below the minimum stake requirements of a validator,
 or above the stake capacity of a single validator.
 as rewards fluctuate with validator performance and is dependent on its inclusion in the validator set

## What is staking?

by staking your APT(aptos native coin) coins you help secure the network
 and earn rewards from the aptos protocol for doing so. More effective the validator you stake with is, 
 the higher the reward rate

 for further explaination of how validators are awarded

## why stake instead of providing liquidity to a pool
LP fees in a single pool are inconsistent because volume exchanged in these pools can fluctuate wildly day to day
 in most cases when acting as an LP
staking is generally viewed as a safer option than providing liquidity for a pool since its dependent 
 on the security of the core of the chain

### what are the drawbacks of staking?

with a traditional staking mechanism a user cannot withdraw their funds at an instants' notice.
when staking within an L1 the staker has exposure to a single token and are unable to respond to impermenent loss accrued.

### What determines the APY of staking on aptos
    the stake fees accumulated by the are impacted by two things in the aptos ecosystem.
    1. number of successful votes cast
    2. the remaining lockup period
      
### how is staking on aptos different from other protocols?
on Aptos there  is a max that a single validator can stake 
 and the staker is required to set a minimum stake duration on deposit.
  Other L1s have minimum stake durations but aptos is unique by having the staker specify this value upon deposit.


rewards linear decline of the reward rate as the end of the lockup period is also unique. 
This is not ideal for someone who is unsure how long they would like to stake, and who's decision.
