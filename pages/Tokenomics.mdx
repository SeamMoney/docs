# SEAM Token Structure

$SEAM is the utility, governance, and staking token which acts as the mechanism for decentralized governance over SeamDAO. The SEAM token adopts the [Coin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move) type developed by Aptos, using Aptos Move code. The SeamDAO will deploy the SEAM coin contract on November 30, 2022 with a max supply of 1,000,000,000 SEAM.

## Protocol Revenue

A 0.3% transaction fee is charged on total deposit amount into a Seam Power Set. This acts as a way for the protocol to load up on coins to pay for gas fees from the strategy's transaction flow. Another 5% is charged on the profit a user earns from their Seam Power Set position.

Of the 5% management fee on each position, 20% gets sent to the SeamDAO treasury to be re-invested according to DAO decisions, and 80% is converted to SEAM/USDC LP and distributed to SEAM stakers.

## Token Utility

Regarding future utility mechanisms, one idea is to create a proposal through the SeamDAO in order to launch an Incentivized Mining Program for users to compete for who can create the highest performing Power Set using Seam. Fund creators will receive SEAM token rewards for how they rank, and potentially also earn a higher percentage of protocol revenue. This only applies to non Principal Power Sets that are created and listed through a governance vote.

## Seam Governance

The SeamDAO treasury is controlled by SEAM stakers.
