# Stake with Seam

Seam allows users to deploy and manage stake across multiple validators
 and transfer the ability to claim the stake deposit plus accrued yield(staking fees
 <Bleed>![Nextra Example](../public/seam-thumbnail.png)</Bleed>)

 ### How you can deploy stake to validators with seam

 flow 1 - currated validator sets
    * user selects a stake period
    * deploy stake accross 4 high-performance validators(strong voting record) not at staking capacity
    motivations: user does not operate a validator
                user is uncomfortable deploying and managing stake via the CLI
                user would like to speculate 

 flow 2: user selected validator set
     - user stakes on validators of their choosing

    motivations: 
        - user operates validators and would like to optimize capital accross their set
        - user would like to adjust their exposure to staked asset


result: user holds a Token minted by the seam protocol which when transfered back 
 to the protocol is redemed for the initial stake and the stake fees generated during the duration 
 that they held the 
 
## After Staking

after a user has created the position above they are able to manage it the following ways

### claim rewards
in the aptos staking mechanism rewards are Distributed at the end of every epoch. At this time
 at this time users can claim their stake rewards with  

 
### sell staked position
    sell on the 'open market' - via our app or any nft marketplace
  sale formats:
                        * fixed price
                        * dutch auction (decending price auction,price lowers at a set rate, no time limit)
                        * traditional auction (buyer sets opening price and time limit)
    motivation:
            * staker no longer wants their funds tied up
            * staker believes current value of staked position is greater than the value at unlock

this sale could be denominated in any coin,
 but to pull apart the motivations of each party lets assume it was sold for the same asset that was staked

    result(original staker): staker created an mechanism to speculate on net value of staked asset + stake yield
    result(buyer): buyer now holds the right right to claim stake rewards, relock and claim the stake deposit at the end of the time lock


### conditionally sell position(portion or whole)
    the provider of stake would like to hedge their risk they can add a conditional on their stake deposit.
    some examples of conditions might be price of APT on a dex on aptos
