# Distributed staking
a mechanism to deploy stake across multiple validators via a single entry point

Seam allows users to split stake deposits across multiple validators. 
This is ideal not only for decentralization of the network, but also also creates a more stable ROI for the 'staker' as rewards fluctuate with validator performance(voting performance)

reward rate on aptos

rewards_rate = Maximum possible reward * (Remaining lockup / Maximum lockup)

Reward = Maximum possible reward * (Remaining lockup / Maximum lockup) * (Number of successful votes / Total number of blocks in the current epoch)




This is done in the seam protocol through the use of the OwnerCapability mechanism provided by the staking module.
 with this custodian model the seam protocol is able to mint a token that bears the ownership of the staked APT.
  This is important because it allows the right to claim the stake deposit, plus accrued staking fees.
