# Stake with Seam

Seam allows users to deploy and manage stake across multiple validators
 and transfer the ability to claim the stake deposit plus accrued yield(staking fees)

 ### How you can deploy stake to validators with seam

 flow 1: currated validator sets
    -user selects a stake period
    - deploy stake accross 4 high-performance validators not at staking capacity
    - user 
    motivations: user does not operate a validator
                user is uncomfortable deploying and managing stake via the CLI
                user would like to speculate 

 flow 2: user selected validator set
    -user stakes on validators of their choosing

    motivations: user operates validators and would like to optimize capital accross their set
                user would like to adjust their exposure to staked asset


result: user holds a MoveResource of a Token minted by the seam protocol which when transfered back 
 to the protocol is redemed for the initial stake and the stake fees generated
 
### After Staking

after a user has created the position above they are able to manage it the following ways

### claim rewards
in the aptos staking mechanism rewards are Distributed at the end of every epoch. At this time
 at this time users can claim their stake rewards with  

 
### sell staked position
    sell on the 'open market' - via our app or any nft marketplace
  sale formats:
                        -fixed price
                        -dutch auction (decending price auction,price lowers at a set rate, no time limit)
                        -traditional auction (buyer sets opening and time limit)
    motivation:
            - staker no longer wants their funds tied up
            - staker belives current value of staked position is greater than the value at unlock

    this sale could be denomiated in any coin,
     but to pull apart the motivations of each party lets assume it was sold for the same asset that was staked

     result(original staker): staker created an mechanism to speculate on net value of a
    result: staker created an mechanism to speculate on net value


### conditionally sell position(portion or whole)
    the provider of stake would like to hedge their risk they can add a conditional on their stake deposit.
    some examples of conditions might be price
