# $SEAM Token Structure

SEAM is the utility, governance, and staking token which acts as the mechanism for decentralized governance over SeamDAO. The $SEAM token adopts the [Coin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move) type developed by Aptos, using Aptos Move code. The SeamDAO will deploy the SEAM coin contract on November 30, 2022 with a max supply of 1,000,000,000 SEAM.

### Protocol Revenue

0.03% of user position amounts will be charged upon deposit into a Seam Set. This acts as a way for the protocol to load up on coins to pay for gas fees from the set. Another 0.3% of set-generated profit will be directed back to the SeamDAO treasury when a user withdraws from their position.
