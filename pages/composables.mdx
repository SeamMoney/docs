# Composable defi products for pools,lending, on-chain orderbooks

## Seam pools

seam pools are multi-protocol composite positions.

these give users the ability to hold a diverse set of positions accross different dapps.


Types + examples of protocols we are are considering integrating:
* liquidswap - dex
    Usage: swap and pools
* hippo - dex + aggregator
    usage: swap and pools
* aries - margin trading
    usage: takout leveraged shorts and longs

* Aptin - lending and borrowing
    usage: increase / decrease exposures

* tsunami - spot trades + leveraged
    usage: conditional order execution

* econia -  framework onchain orderbook
    usage: limit orders

an example of a composite could be a deposit of 10k APT which is split into 3 pools across
 2 platforms. A
### what is unique about creating positions with seam

unlike other defi product aggregators, seam allows you to wrap these positions together into one custodial token.
from this token the user is able to claim rewards from yields/staking(+increse timelock), 
 and mint a 'conditional' right to claim all or a portion of the managed position. 
 
 This can be kept by the minter to ensure the close of a position at the expiry if the condition expires valid.
 A Minter may also choose to sell, effectivly hedgeing

### first pools
for our first set of pools the first composed pools will provide a fixed ratio multi-LP position.

an example of this could be a combination of pools providing liquidity
 to a set of liquidity pools provided by the integrations above
 
some composables could roughly be the following:
    - a pool with fixed ratio deposits across APT/(BTC,ETH,SOL) pools
    - provide liquidity to pool X/Z with supply of X to lending market for borrowing X + Z
    - increase exposure with lend + borrow to sell long on orderbook
    - stake and sell short(via orderbook) to limit poten
